In Java, checking if a PIN is correct can be done by comparing the user’s input with a stored PIN. If both match, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied. Example: store int pin=1234;, read user input, and use if(entered==pin) to print “PIN is correct” else “PIN is incorrect”. Simple and secure validation. ✅
